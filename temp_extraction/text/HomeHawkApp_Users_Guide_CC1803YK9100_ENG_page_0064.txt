Automatic Mode Switching
You can enable modes to be switched automatically depending on your location as determined by
geo-fencing.
Geo-fencing is a location-based feature that can set up virtual boundaries around a geographical location
such as your home. When devices (mobile devices, etc.) enter or exit these boundaries, actions
(changing modes, etc.) can be triggered.
To use geo-fencing, you must allow the [HomeHawk] app to use the location of your mobile device.
Note:
R In order to use Automatic Mode Switching with the geo-fencing feature, your mobile device must be
able to communicate with your camera. Therefore, the mode may not switch automatically in the
following situations.
– your mobile device and/or your camera do not have good network conditions
– your mobile device's battery does not have adequate charge remaining to use the Automatic Mode
Switching feature
In these cases, start the [HomeHawk] app on your mobile device.
