Setting up the HD camera
Before you begin
In this procedure, the camera will enter “temporary access point mode”. In this mode, you can use your

Confirm the following before you begin.
– Make sure you have installed the [HomeHawk] app on your mobile device
– Make sure the camera is located within range of your wireless router
– Make sure your mobile device is connected to your wireless router
