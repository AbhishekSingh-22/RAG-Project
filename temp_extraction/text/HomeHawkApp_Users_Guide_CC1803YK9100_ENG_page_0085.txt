Floor camera mode settings
Floor camera mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the cameras to operate according to pre-determined settings. You can use modes to match
where you are (at home, away from home, etc.) and what actions you want cameras to make (record
images when motion is detected, etc.). You can use preset modes or create your own modes.
Examples
The following are some examples of how you can use modes.
– I want the camera light to turn on when I arrive home and turn off when I leave home
– I want the camera to record images and make a sound when motion is detected by the camera
– I want to receive notifications when motion is detected by the camera
– I want the privacy mode to turn on when I arrive home so that camera images can’t be viewed
(geo-fencing ( “Automatic Mode Switching”, Page 87) must be enabled)
Preset modes
There are 3 preset modes that can be used for cameras: [Basic], [Home], and [Away].
– [Basic]:
Use this if you don't want to use a mode and don't want the camera to operate according to
pre-determined settings.
– [Home]:
This mode is typically used when you are at home. Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Turn on the light when you arrive home

R You don’t want the camera to:
→Record images or make sounds when motion is detected

The following describes the settings for the [Home] and [Away] modes.
Settings for when the mode changes
You can specify the settings for when the mode is activated, such as when you select this mode or when
it is automatically activated via automatic mode switching using geo-fencing ( “Automatic Mode
Switching”, Page 87).
