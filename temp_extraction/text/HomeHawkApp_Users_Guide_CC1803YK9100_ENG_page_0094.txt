Window camera features
Window camera features (overview)
You can use a window camera to monitor and record the area where the camera is located. Window
cameras have built-in motion detection features. When the motion detection is triggered, camera images
can be recorded and notifications can be sent to your mobile device. It is possible to distinguish between
motion for people and objects. You can use [Person Only] notifications ( “Once motion is detected”,
Page 107) to only receive notifications when motion is detected for people. You can also filter recordings
to only show you recordings where motion was detected for people. Additionally, 24/7 recording ( “Preset
modes”, Page 106) is also available.
Viewing the camera image/recording list screen
The camera image/recording list screen shows live images and a list of recordings for the selected
camera.
To access the camera image/recording list screen, tap the desired camera from the [HomeHawk] app
home screen ( “Shelf camera, floor camera, and window camera home screen”, Page 23).
