R Higher frame rates mean images are refreshed faster and moving subjects are displayed more
smoothly, however, images displayed on your mobile device may be delayed and sound may cut out
or be delayed when talking to the camera (shelf cameras and floor cameras only), especially over a
slow or congested network connection.
R Lower frame rates mean images are refreshed less often and moving subjects may appear “choppy”,
however, images displayed on your mobile device will be less delayed and sound may be more
consistent when talking (shelf cameras and floor cameras only) to the camera over a slow or
