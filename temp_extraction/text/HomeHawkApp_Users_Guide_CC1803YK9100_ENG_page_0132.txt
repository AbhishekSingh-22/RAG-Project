Mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the access points and their connected front door cameras and outdoor cameras to operate
according to pre-determined settings when motion is detected. The same mode is used for all front door
cameras and outdoor cameras connected to the same access point. You can use preset modes, or
create your own modes. Each mode answers the following questions.
1
What sounds are made?
– Example: Beeps, announcements, etc.
2
Which cameras record images and for how long?
3
Are cameras combined together for pre-recording?
– Example: 2 cameras can be linked together so that if 1 camera detects motion, the other camera
starts pre-recording. (Images are temporarily stored, and if motion is detected later, images are
then saved on the access point’s SD card.)
4
Are notifications sent to mobile devices when motion is detected?
Note:
R Modes cannot be used with HD cameras.
