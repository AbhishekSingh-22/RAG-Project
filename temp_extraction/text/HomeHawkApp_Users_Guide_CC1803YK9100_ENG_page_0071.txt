Floor camera features (overview)
You can use a floor camera to monitor and record the sights and sounds of the area where the camera is
located. Floor cameras have built-in motion, sound, and temperature detection features. When the
motion detection is triggered, camera images can be recorded, notifications can be sent to your mobile
device, and beeps can be sounded from the camera. When the sound or temperature detection is
triggered, notifications can be sent to your mobile device. Additionally, built-in speakers and microphones
allow you to talk to anyone who is near the camera. Floor cameras also have a light that can be turned
on and off, and adjusted to 3 different levels.
