Front door camera and outdoor camera features (overview)
You can use front door cameras and outdoor cameras to monitor and record the sights and sounds of the
area where the cameras are located. Cameras have built-in motion detection features that, when
triggered, allow cameras to record images automatically or send a notification to your mobile device.
Additionally, built-in speakers and microphones allow you to talk to anyone who is near the camera.
Note:
R Front door cameras and outdoor cameras may stop working in extremely high or low temperatures.
Normal operations will resume once the temperature is within the supported levels. See  “The camera
will not charge (the charging LED indicator blinks quickly in red)”, Page 191.
