Shelf camera features
Shelf camera features (overview)
You can use a shelf camera to monitor and record the sights and sounds of the area where the camera is
located. Shelf cameras have built-in motion, sound, and temperature detection features. When the
motion detection is triggered, camera images can be recorded, notifications can be sent to your mobile
device, and beeps can be sounded from the camera. When the sound or temperature detection is
triggered, notifications can be sent to your mobile device. Additionally, built-in speakers and microphones
allow you to talk to anyone who is near the camera.
Viewing the camera image/recording list screen
The camera image/recording list screen shows live images and a list of recordings for the selected
camera.
To access the camera image/recording list screen, tap the desired camera from the [HomeHawk] app
home screen ( “Shelf camera, floor camera, and window camera home screen”, Page 23).
