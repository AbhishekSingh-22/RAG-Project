Sync
You can coordinate cameras so that when 1 camera detects motion, the other camera starts

the access point’s SD card.)

access point.

Note:
R After recording has started for a camera, motion detection notifications from that camera are not sent
to mobile devices. However, motion detection notifications from other cameras are sent.
[Play Sound]
You can specify what sounds a camera will automatically make when motion is detected. This can be
used to warn suspicious people approaching your house that they have been detected and that there are
cameras that can record images of them.
