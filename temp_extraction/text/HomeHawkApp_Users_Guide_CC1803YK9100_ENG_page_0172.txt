Deleting wireless access points
The app remembers the SSIDs of wireless routers that you use at home to connect to the camera; it can
remember 10 SSIDs, and saves them in the wireless access point list. If the list is full and you try to
connect to the camera using a new SSID while at home, the app may connect to the camera over the
Internet even though you are at home. In this case, we recommend deleting unused SSIDs from the
wireless access point list.
