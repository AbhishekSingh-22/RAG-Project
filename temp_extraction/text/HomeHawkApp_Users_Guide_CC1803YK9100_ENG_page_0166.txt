or be delayed when talking to the camera, especially over a slow or congested network connection.
R Lower frame rates mean images are refreshed less often and moving subjects may appear “choppy”,
however, images displayed on your mobile device will be less delayed and sound may be more
consistent when talking to the camera over a slow or congested network connection.
