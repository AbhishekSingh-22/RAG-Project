This document serves as a technical support guide for setting up a new smart home device using the Matter protocol.

---

### 1. What is the PURPOSE of this screen/diagram?

The purpose is to provide clear, actionable steps for integrating a new Matter-certified device (specifically a Panasonic Air Conditioner) into the user’s smart home ecosystem application, the **MirAIe Application**. It outlines the initial navigation steps and provides two distinct methods for secure device pairing.

### 2. What ACTION should the user take?

The user must follow a two-step process to initiate and complete the device pairing:

**Step 1: Initiate Addition**
*   Open the MirAIe application dashboard.
*   Locate and click the **"+"** (plus) icon to begin the device addition process.

**Step 2: Complete Pairing (Choose one of the following methods)**

*   **Method A: Scan QR Code:** Center the device’s unique QR code (found on the physical unit or its packaging) within the camera frame provided by the application.
*   **Method B: Enter Setup Code Manually:** Locate the 11-digit or 21-digit Manual Pairing Code (also found on the device/packaging) and type it into the dedicated input field, then press the **"Connect"** button.

### 3. What PROBLEM does this help solve?

This guide solves the problem of **device discovery and secure connectivity** for smart home products operating on the Matter standard.

*   **Interoperability:** It explains how devices from different manufacturers (e.g., a Panasonic AC) can be added to a centralized smart home app (MirAIe) using a universal, standardized setup process (Matter).
*   **Failed Setup Redundancy:** It provides a crucial backup method (manual code entry) in case the primary method (QR code scanning) fails due to issues like poor lighting, camera malfunction, or a damaged/obscured QR code sticker.

### 4. Explain any error codes or status indicators in terms of user troubleshooting.

The guide does not display active error codes, but it highlights specific required inputs that serve as troubleshooting indicators:

| Status Indicator / Requirement | User Troubleshooting Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QR Code Location** | If the initial scan fails, the user must verify they are aiming the camera at the specific QR Code Sticker found on the **AC unit** or the **packaging**, as these contain the necessary Matter credential data. |
| **Manual Pairing Code Format (11 or 21 digits)** | If the user attempts to enter the setup code manually, the application requires exactly 11 or 21 digits. If the user enters a code of the wrong length or an incorrect format, the app will typically reject the entry or disable the "Connect" button. The user must double-check the physical sticker to ensure the correct number of digits is input. |
| **"Add Matter device using setup code" Screen** | This screen functions as a built-in troubleshooting alternative. If the QR scan fails, the user is immediately routed to the manual entry method, ensuring setup can proceed without interruption. |
