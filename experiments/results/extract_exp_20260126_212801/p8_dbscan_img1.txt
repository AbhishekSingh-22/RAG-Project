This diagram serves as a technical walkthrough for integrating a smart device ecosystem with a voice assistant platform.

---

### 1. What is the PURPOSE of this screen/diagram?

The purpose of this guide is to provide the required sequence of steps for **enabling the Panasonic MirAIe Smart Home skill** within the Amazon Alexa application. This integration allows the user to establish a communication link between their Panasonic devices (specifically the Smart Air Conditioner) and the Amazon voice control ecosystem.

### 2. What ACTION should the user take?

The user must perform two primary actions:

1.  **Search and Select:** Open the Amazon Alexa application, navigate to the skills section, and use the search function to locate the specific skill using the query `panasonic miraie`. Once located, the user must select the correct skill entry ("Panasonic MirAIe").
2.  **Enable and Link Account:** Tap the **"ENABLE TO USE"** button. This action will initiate the crucial **Account linking required** process, where the user must provide their existing Panasonic MirAIe app username and password on the subsequent Panasonic Identity Server login page to authorize Alexa access to their smart devices.

### 3. What PROBLEM does this help solve?

This instructional guide solves the problem of **device non-recognition and lack of voice control** for the Panasonic Smart Air Conditioner.

Specifically, it bridges the gap between the proprietary Panasonic Smart Home infrastructure and the universal Amazon Alexa platform, enabling the user to control device functions (e.g., changing temperature, turning the unit on/off, adjusting fan speed) using spoken commands rather than manually through the phone application.

### 4. Explain any error codes or status indicators in terms of user troubleshooting.

While there are no explicit numeric error codes (e.g., 404, 503) displayed, the screens provide critical status indicators necessary for successful troubleshooting:

| Status Indicator / Feature | Meaning | User Troubleshooting Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Account linking required"** | The connection between Alexa and the Panasonic server is incomplete; the skill is enabled but not authorized to see or control the user's devices. | **Critical Step Missed:** The user must successfully log in using their credentials for the Panasonic MirAIe account on the prompt that appears *after* tapping "ENABLE TO USE." If linking fails, the user must verify their Panasonic username and password are correct. |
| **No "Panasonic MirAIe" in search results** (Implicit) | The Alexa App could not find the skill based on the search term, or the skill may not be available in the user’s geographic region. | **Verification:** Double-check the spelling (`panasonic miraie`). If the spelling is correct, confirm the user’s Amazon account region supports this specific skill. |
| **Example Commands Listed** (e.g., "Alexa, turn on my AC.") | These confirm the successful function and syntax the user should employ once linking is complete. | **Post-Setup Confirmation:** If the skill is enabled but these commands don't work, it suggests that the *account linking* failed or the Smart AC device itself is not properly configured within the original Panasonic MirAIe app. |
| **"ENABLE TO USE" Button is Present** (vs. "DISABLE SKILL") | This indicates the current status is that the skill is not yet active on the user's account. | **Next Step Confirmation:** If the user sees a button labeled "DISABLE SKILL," it means the skill is already enabled and the troubleshooting focus should shift to device setup or account linking integrity. |
