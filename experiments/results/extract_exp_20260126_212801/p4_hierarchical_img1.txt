The screen does not display any explicit error codes, but it does show a crucial **prerequisite status indicator/warning** that is key for troubleshooting:

| Indicator/Status | Meaning | Troubleshooting Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Please make sure that Wi-Fi and Location is enabled in your smart phone"** (Information Icon) | This indicates that two essential phone functions (Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS/Location services) are mandatory for the device pairing process to begin successfully. | **If setup fails or the device list does not load:** Verify your smartphone settings. Ensure both Wi-Fi is actively connected to your home network, and the phone's Location (GPS) setting is turned on. Many smart device protocols (like Bluetooth or local network scanning) require location permission to function correctly, even if you are only using Wi-Fi. |
