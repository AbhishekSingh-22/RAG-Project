This image is a segment of technical documentation, likely from a manual or datasheet, presented in a clean, structured, text-heavy layout with embedded product images. The primary color scheme is black text on a white background.

### Layout and Organization

The document is organized sequentially, starting with introductory text, followed by a "Note," a section detailing devices compatible with access points, and concluding with specifications on the maximum number of registered devices.

1.  **Introduction:** Two lines of introductory text appear at the top.
2.  **Note Section:** A section titled "Note:" uses bullet points (black circular icons) for important disclaimers. A thin, horizontal gray line separates this section from the main content below.
3.  **Device Listing:** This main section lists three categories of devices: Access point, Front door camera, and Outdoor camera. Each category includes the model numbers in parentheses and is accompanied by a corresponding product image placed to the left of descriptive text. The descriptive text uses bolding for the category name and structured sub-points (Overview, Setup/Registration, Features).
4.  **Maximum Device Count:** The bottom section is titled "Maximum number of devices that can be registered" and uses bullet points and indented dashes to list specific quantity limitations.

### Text Content

**Introduction/Preamble:**
*   "The maximum number of camera devices for each type are listed below."
*   "In order to use front door cameras and outdoor cameras, they must be connected to an access point."

**Note Section:**
*   **Note:**
    *   "Availability and release dates of devices and bundles may vary by region."
    *   "Device appearance may vary by region."

**Device Section Heading:**
*   "Devices for use with access points (KX-HNB700, KX-HNB705)" (The model numbers in the heading are slightly truncated or obscured, but the pattern suggests the full model numbers are intended.)

**Access point (KX-HNB700, KX-HNB705):**
*   **Overview:** Access point (KX-HNB700, KX-HNB705)

*   **Registration:** Registering front door cameras and outdoor cameras
*   **Features:** Front door camera and outdoor camera features (overview)

**Outdoor camera (KX-HNC710, KX-HNC715):**
*   **Overview:** Outdoor camera (KX-HNC710, KX-HNC715)
*   **Registration:** Registering front door cameras and outdoor cameras
*   **Features:** Front door camera and outdoor camera features (overview)

**Maximum Device Count Section:**
*   **Maximum number of devices that can be registered**
*   "The maximum number of devices that can be registered to each type of device are listed below."
*   "Number of devices that can be registered to an access point:"
    *   "– Front door cameras and outdoor cameras\*1: 16"
    *   "– Mobile devices: 8"
*   "Number of devices that can be registered to a mobile device:"
    *   "– Access points: 4"

### Icons and Graphics

1.  **Bullet Points:** Small, solid black circles ($\bullet$) are used to denote items in the "Note" section and the main categories in the device registration limits section.
2.  **Indentation Markers:** Dashes (–) are used for sub-items under the "Number of devices that can be registered..." lists.
3.  **Product Images (Visual Representations):**
    *   **Access point:** A tall, slim, white rectangular device with slightly rounded edges, standing vertically. A small "Panasonic" logo is visible near the bottom center of the device face.
    *   **Front door camera:** A long, low-profile, white or light gray rectangular device, resembling an intercom panel, shown horizontally. It features dark circular elements (lenses/sensors) in the center.
    *   **Outdoor camera:** A compact, white/light gray dome or turret-style camera mounted on a short, adjustable pedestal base. The camera housing is rounded, and a dark lens is visible.

### Visual Style

The overall style is characteristic of modern technical documentation: minimalist, high contrast (black text on white background), employing bolding and clear section headings for hierarchy. The use of embedded product photographs alongside specifications provides quick visual reference for the listed hardware models.
