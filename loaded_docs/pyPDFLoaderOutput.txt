 - During abnormally strong lightning activity.
Precaution for using R32 refrigerant
The basic installation work procedures are the same as 
conventional refrigerant (R410A, R22) models.
Since the working pressure is higher than that of 
refrigerant R22 models, some of the piping and 
installation and service tools are special.
Especially, when replacing a refrigerant R22 
model with a new refrigerant R32 model, always 
replace the conventional piping and flare nuts 
with the R32 and R410A piping and flare nuts on 
the outdoor unit side.
For R32 and R410A, the same flare nut on the 
outdoor unit side and pipe can be used.
Models that use refrigerant R32 and R410A 
have a different charging port thread diameter to 
prevent erroneous charging with refrigerant R22 
and for safety.
Therefore, check beforehand. [The charging port 
thread diameter for R32 and R410A is 1/2 inch.]
Be more careful than R22 so that foreign matter 
(oil, water, etc.) does not enter the piping.
Also, when storing the piping, securely seal the 
opening by pinching, taping, etc. (Handling of 
R32 is similar to R410A.)
CAUTION
Indoor unit and outdoor unit
Do not wash the indoor unit with water, benzine, 
thinner or scouring powder to avoid damage or 
corrosion at the unit.
Do not use for preservation of precise 
equipment, food, animals, plants, artwork 
or other objects. This may cause quality 
deterioration, etc.
Do not use any combustible equipment in front 
of the airflow outlet to avoid fire propagation.
Do not expose plants or pet directly to airflow to 
avoid injury, etc.
Do not touch the sharp aluminium fin, 
sharp parts may cause injury.
Do not switch ON the indoor unit when waxing 
the floor. After waxing, aerate the room properly 
before operating the unit.

checked for the presence of refrigerant.
 - Marking to the equipment continues to be 
visible and legible. Markings and signs that 
are illegible shall be corrected.
 - Refrigeration pipe or components are 
installed in a position where they are unlikely 
to be exposed to any substance which may 
corrode refrigerant containing components, 
unless the components are constructed of 
materials which are inherently resistant to 
being corroded or are properly protected 
against being so corroded.
2-8. Checks to electrical devices
• Repair and maintenance to electrical 
components shall include initial safety 
checks and component inspection 
procedures.
• Initial safety checks shall include but not 
limit to:-
 - That capacitors are discharged: this 
shall be done in a safe manner to avoid

form of leak detection shall be located at the 
most critical point to warn of a potentially 
hazardous situation.
• Particular attention shall be paid to the 
following to ensure that by working on 
electrical components, the casing is not 
altered in such a way that the level of 
protection is affected.
This shall include damage to cables, 
excessive number of connections, terminals 
not made to original specifi  cation, damage to 
seals, incorrect fi  tting of glands, etc.
• Ensure that apparatus is mounted securely.
• Ensure that seals or sealing materials have 
not degraded such that they no longer serve 
the purpose of preventing the ingress of 
fl  ammable atmospheres.
• Replacement parts shall be in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s specifi  cations.
NOTE: The use of silicon sealant may inhibit 
the effectiveness of some types of leak 
detection equipment.

4. Repair to intrinsically safe components
• Do not apply any permanent inductive or 
capacitance loads to the circuit without 
ensuring that this will not exceed the 
permissible voltage and current permitted for 
the equipment in use.
• Intrinsically safe components are the only 
types that can be worked on while live in the 
presence of a fl  ammable atmosphere.
• The test apparatus shall be at the correct 
rating.
• Replace components only with parts 
specifi  ed by the manufacturer. Unspecifi  ed 
parts by manufacturer may result ignition of 
refrigerant in the atmosphere from a leak.
5. Cabling
• Check that cabling will not be subject 
to wear, corrosion, excessive pressure, 
vibration, sharp edges or any other adverse 
environmental effects.
• The check shall also take into account the 
effects of aging or continual vibration from 
sources such as compressors or fans.
6. Detection of fl ammable refrigerants
• Under no circumstances shall potential 
sources of ignition be used in the searching 
or detection of refrigerant leaks.
• A halide torch (or any other detector using a 
naked fl  ame) shall not be used.
7. Leak detection methods
• Electronic leak detectors shall be used 
to detect fl  ammable refrigerants, but the 
sensitivity may not be adequate, or may 
need re-calibration.
(Detection equipment shall be calibrated in a 
refrigerant-free area.)
• Ensure that the detector is not a potential 
source of ignition and is suitable for the 
refrigerant used.
• Leak detection equipment shall be set at 
a percentage of the LFL of the refrigerant 
and shall be calibrated to the refrigerant 
employed and the appropriate percentage of 
gas (25 % maximum) is confi  rmed.
• Leak detection fl uids are suitable for use with 
most refrigerants but the use of detergents 
containing chlorine shall be avoided as the 
chlorine may react with the refrigerant and 
corrode the copper pipe-work.
• If a leak is suspected, all naked fl  ames shall 
be removed/extinguished.
• If a leakage of refrigerant is found which 
requires brazing, all of the refrigerant shall 
be recovered from the system, or isolated 
(by means of shut off valves) in a part of the 
system remote from the leak. Oxygen free 
nitrogen (OFN) shall then be purged through 
the system both before and during the 
brazing process.
8. Removal and evacuation
• When breaking into the refrigerant circuit to make 
repairs – or for any other purpose – conventional 
procedures shall be used.
However, it is important that best practice is 
followed since 
fl ammability is a consideration.
The following procedure shall be adhered to:
remove refrigerant -> purge the circuit with inert 
gas -> evacuate -> purge again with inert gas -> 
open the circuit by cutting or brazing
• The refrigerant charge shall be recovered into 
the correct recovery cylinders.
• The system shall be “fl ushed” with OFN to 
render the unit safe.
• This process may need to be repeated several times.
• Compressed air or oxygen shall not be used 
for this task.
• Flushing shall be achieved by breaking the 
vacuum in the system with OFN and continuing 
to 
fi ll until the working pressure is achieved, 
then venting to atmosphere, and fi nally pulling 
down to a vacuum.
• This process shall be repeated until no 
refrigerant is within the system.
• When the fi nal OFN charge is used, the system 
shall be vented down to atmospheric pressure 
to enable work to take place.
• This operation is absolutely vital if brazing 
operations on the pipe work are to take place.
• Ensure that the outlet for the vacuum pump is 
not close to any ignition sources and there is 
ventilation available.
9. Charging procedures
• In addition to conventional charging procedures, 
the following requirements shall be followed.
 - Ensure that contamination of different 
refrigerants does not occur when using 
charging equipment.
 - Hoses or lines shall be as short as possible to 
minimize the amount of refrigerant contained 
in them.
 - Cylinders shall be kept upright.
 - Ensure that the refrigeration system is earthed 
prior to charging the system with refrigerant.
 - Label the system when charging is complete 
(if not already).
 - Extreme care shall be taken not to over fi ll the 
refrigeration system.
• Prior to recharging the system it shall be 
pressure tested with OFN (refer to #7).
• The system shall be leak tested on completion 
of charging but prior to commissioning.
• A follow up leak test shall be carried out prior to 
leaving the site.
• Electrostatic charge may accumulate and 
create a hazardous condition when charging 
and discharging the refrigerant.
To avoid 
fi re or explosion, dissipate static 
electricity during transfer by grounding and 
bonding containers and equipment before 
charging/discharging.

j)  When the cylinders have been fi  lled 
correctly and the process completed, make 
sure that the cylinders and the equipment 
are removed from site promptly and all 
isolation valves on the equipment are 
closed off.
k)  Recovered refrigerant shall not be 
charged into another refrigeration system 
unless it has been cleaned and checked.
• Electrostatic charge may accumulate and 
create a hazardous condition when charging 
or discharging the refrigerant.
To avoid fi  re or explosion, dissipate static 
electricity during transfer by grounding and 
bonding containers and equipment before 
charging/discharging.
11. Labelling
• Equipment shall be labelled stating that it 
has been de-commissioned and emptied of 
refrigerant.
• The label shall be dated and signed.
• Ensure that there are labels on the 
equipment stating the equipment contains 
fl  ammable refrigerant.
12. Recovery
• When removing refrigerant from a system, 
either for servicing or decommissioning, 
it is recommended good practice that all 
refrigerants are removed safely.
• When transferring refrigerant into cylinders, 
ensure that only appropriate refrigerant 
recovery cylinders are employed.
• Ensure that the correct number of cylinders 
for holding the total system charge are 
available.
• All cylinders to be used are designated for 
the recovered refrigerant and labelled for 
that refrigerant (i.e. special cylinders for the 
recovery of refrigerant).
• Cylinders shall be complete with pressure 
relief valve and associated shut-off valves in 
good working order.
• Recovery cylinders are evacuated and, if 
possible, cooled before recovery occurs.
• The recovery equipment shall be in good 
working order with a set of instructions 
concerning the equipment that is at hand 
and shall be suitable for the recovery of 
fl  ammable refrigerants.
• In addition, a set of calibrated weighing 
scales shall be available and in good 
working order.
• Hoses shall be complete with leak-free 
disconnect couplings and in good condition.
• Before using the recovery machine, check 
that it is in satisfactory working order, has 
been properly maintained and that any 
associated electrical components are 
sealed to prevent ignition in the event of a 
refrigerant release.
Consult manufacturer if in doubt.
• The recovered refrigerant shall be returned 
to the refrigerant supplier in the correct 
recovery cylinder, and the relevant Waste 
Transfer Note arranged.
• Do not mix refrigerants in recovery units and 
especially not in cylinders.
• If compressors or compressor oils are to 
be removed, ensure that they have been 
evacuated to an acceptable level to make 
certain that fl  ammable refrigerant does not 
remain within the lubricant.
• The evacuation process shall be carried 
out prior to returning the compressor to the 
suppliers.
• Only electric heating to the compressor 
body shall be employed to accelerate this 
process.
• When oil is drained from a system, it shall be 
carried out safely.

App basics
App basics (overview)
To begin, simply start the [HomeHawk] app on your mobile device by tapping its icon (shown below).
To prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you may need to enter a system password. Whether or
not you need to enter the system password depends on how your mobile device is connecting to your
devices, as explained below.
Accessing while at home
If your mobile device is connected to the same wireless network as your devices, you do not need to
enter the system password when connecting to your devices. This is because it is assumed that in this
situation, anyone in your home who is using your mobile device is authorized to access your devices.
Note that even when you are at home, you will need to enter the system password if your mobile device
is not connected to the same wireless network as your devices. This could occur if your mobile device is
connected to the Internet using its mobile network connection instead of your wireless network, or if your
mobile device is connected to a different wireless network.
Accessing while away from home
If your mobile device is not connected to the same wireless network as your devices, including situations
when you are away from home, you will need to enter the system password when connecting to your
devices. This is to prevent someone from using your mobile device to access your devices in the event
that you lose your mobile device while away from home, for example.
Note:
R The password is set during initial setup.

“Login settings”, Page 116
– Access points, front door cameras, and outdoor cameras:
“Login settings”, Page 144
– HD cameras:
“[Automatic Login]”, Page 169
R If the app disconnects from your devices while away from home (such as when you turn your mobile
device’s screen off and then on, or you switch to another app and then return to the [HomeHawk]
app), the app’s home screen will be displayed instead of the last screen you were viewing. Also note
that in this case, it may take some time for the app’s screen to be displayed.
Automatic login
When entering the login password, you can enable the automatic login feature by turning on the
[Automatic Login (for remote access)] checkbox. In this case, the password that you enter will be
saved, allowing the [HomeHawk] app to connect to your devices automatically.
Note:
R You can turn this feature on and off later if desired.

Important:
R Turning on this feature could allow unauthorized parties to access your devices if they are using your
mobile device.
Privacy information
Certain features of the app function by accessing your mobile device’s hardware, such as the
microphone, or the information stored in your mobile device. While using the app, a dialog may be
displayed that asks whether you want to allow the app to access these features of your mobile device.
You can change this setting later if desired in the privacy section of your mobile device’s [Settings] app.
R Please note the following for location information and geo-fencing features.
– Access to location information is required to obtain wireless LAN information and location
information for use with the geo-fencing feature.
– If a dialog is displayed requesting access to location information, allow access.
– When using the geo-fencing feature, set access to location information to always allow.
Using the home screen
The [HomeHawk] app home screen is displayed when you start the app.

Shelf camera mode settings
Shelf camera mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the cameras to operate according to pre-determined settings. You can use modes to match
where you are (at home, away from home, etc.) and what actions you want cameras to make (record
images when motion is detected, etc.). You can use preset modes or create your own modes.
Examples
The following are some examples of how you can use modes.
– I want the camera to record images and make a sound when motion is detected by the camera
– I want to receive notifications when motion is detected by the camera
– I want the privacy mode to turn on when I arrive home so that camera images can’t be viewed
(geo-fencing ( “Automatic Mode Switching”, Page 64) must be enabled)
Preset modes
There are 3 preset modes that can be used for cameras: [Basic], [Home], and [Away].
– [Basic]:
Use this if you don't want to use a mode and don't want the camera to operate according to
pre-determined settings.
– [Home]:
This mode is typically used when you are at home. Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Turn on the privacy mode when you arrive home
R You don’t want the camera to:
→Record images or make sounds when motion is detected
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
– [Away]:
This mode is typically used when you are away from home. Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Record images or make sounds when motion is detected
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
→Turn off the privacy mode when you leave home
The following describes the settings for the [Home] and [Away] modes.
Settings for when the mode changes
You can specify the settings for when the mode is activated, such as when you select this mode or when
it is automatically activated via automatic mode switching using geo-fencing ( “Automatic Mode
Switching”, Page 64).

Floor camera mode settings
Floor camera mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the cameras to operate according to pre-determined settings. You can use modes to match
where you are (at home, away from home, etc.) and what actions you want cameras to make (record
images when motion is detected, etc.). You can use preset modes or create your own modes.
Examples
The following are some examples of how you can use modes.
– I want the camera light to turn on when I arrive home and turn off when I leave home
– I want the camera to record images and make a sound when motion is detected by the camera
– I want to receive notifications when motion is detected by the camera
– I want the privacy mode to turn on when I arrive home so that camera images can’t be viewed
(geo-fencing ( “Automatic Mode Switching”, Page 87) must be enabled)
Preset modes
There are 3 preset modes that can be used for cameras: [Basic], [Home], and [Away].
– [Basic]:
Use this if you don't want to use a mode and don't want the camera to operate according to
pre-determined settings.
– [Home]:
This mode is typically used when you are at home. Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Turn on the light when you arrive home
→Turn on the privacy mode when you arrive home
R You don’t want the camera to:
→Record images or make sounds when motion is detected
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
– [Away]:
This mode is typically used when you are away from home. Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Record images or make sounds when motion is detected
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
→Turn off the light when you leave home
→Turn off the privacy mode when you leave home
The following describes the settings for the [Home] and [Away] modes.

Window camera mode settings
Window camera mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the cameras to operate according to pre-determined settings. You can use modes to match
what actions you want cameras to make (record images when motion is detected, etc.). You can use
preset modes or create your own modes.
Examples
The following are some examples of how you can use modes.
– I want the camera to continually record images 24/7
– I want the camera to record images when motion is detected by the camera
– I want to receive notifications when motion is detected by the camera
Preset modes
There are 3 preset modes that can be used for cameras: [Basic], [Protection], and [24/7 Recording].
– [Basic]:
Use this if you don't want to use a mode and don't want the camera to operate according to
pre-determined settings.
– [Protection]:
Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Turn record images when motion is detected
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
R You don’t want the camera to:
→Record images 24/7
– [24/7 Recording]:
Use this in the following situations.
R You want the camera to:
→Record images 24/7
→Send notifications to you when motion is detected
Note:
R When using [24/7 Recording], because images are continuously recorded, separate recordings are
not made when motion is detected.
R The firmware cannot be updated while [24/7 Recording] is in use. Change the mode to [Basic] to
enable updating.
The following describes the settings for the [Protection] and [24/7 Recording] modes.
Settings for when motion is detected

Mode settings
Mode settings (overview)
Modes allow the access points and their connected front door cameras and outdoor cameras to operate
according to pre-determined settings when motion is detected. The same mode is used for all front door
cameras and outdoor cameras connected to the same access point. You can use preset modes, or
create your own modes. Each mode answers the following questions.
1 What sounds are made?
– Example: Beeps, announcements, etc.
2 Which cameras record images and for how long?
3 Are cameras combined together for pre-recording?
– Example: 2 cameras can be linked together so that if 1 camera detects motion, the other camera
starts pre-recording. (Images are temporarily stored, and if motion is detected later, images are
then saved on the access point’s SD card.)
4 Are notifications sent to mobile devices when motion is detected?
Note:
R Modes cannot be used with HD cameras.
Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use modes.
I want to know when a package arrives
1 What sounds: No sounds are made
2 Which cameras: Camera 1 and Camera 2 record images for 1 minute
3 Are cameras combined: Yes
4 Are notifications sent: Yes
I want to sound a voice alert if a suspicious person approaches my front door
1 What sounds: An announcement is played
2 Which cameras: Camera 1 and Camera 2 record images for 2 minutes

Troubleshooting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial setup
I cannot perform initial setup
R Your mobile device is connecting to a different wireless router during the initial setup procedure.
→If your mobile device can connect to other nearby wireless routers, we recommend you turn them off
or “forget” their settings while performing initial setup.
Connecting from your mobile device
Refer to the following after checking the general troubleshooting information described in  “General
information”, Page 176.
The connection is slow or disconnects while away from home
R There is too much traffic on your home network or on the mobile device’s network.
→Wait for network traffic to decrease.
My mobile device is remotely connected to my devices (
  or 
  is displayed) even while at
home
R Your mobile device's location information feature is disabled, or access to the location information is
denied to the [HomeHawk] app.
→To obtain the SSID of your home's wireless network, access to your mobile device's location
information is required. On your mobile device, enable the location information feature and allow
access to the location information for the [HomeHawk] app.
I cannot connect to my devices
R You replaced your wireless router with a new router, or changed your wireless router’s SSID (i.e.,
wireless network name) or password.
→Your mobile device may have old SSID information. Delete the SSID information in [Home Wireless
Network SSID] (shelf cameras/floor cameras/window cameras:  “Home wireless network SSID
features”, Page 117, HD cameras:  “Deleting wireless access points”, Page 172).
→Deregister the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera from your mobile device
( “Deregistering devices”, Page 41), and then register it again ( “Registering devices”, Page 33).
→Deregister the HD camera from your mobile device ( “Deregistering devices”, Page 41), and then
register it again ( “Registering devices”, Page 33).
R Your wireless router at home is connected to another router.
→If your wireless router is connected to another router, make sure your network is configured so that
your mobile device and your device can communicate over your home network. We recommend
making sure the DHCP feature of only one router is enabled and setting the other routers to “access
point mode” or “bridge mode”.
I cannot connect while away from home
R You are using a public wireless network.
→Network traffic, network conditions, and the network provider’s settings or policies may prevent the
connection. Use a private wireless network or your mobile network service provider’s wireless
network (3G, 4G, etc.).
Sometimes I cannot connect while at home
R There is too much traffic on your home network.
→Wait for network traffic to decrease.
→Refer to the operating instructions included with your wireless router for other possible solutions.
R Your mobile device is discovering too many nearby wireless networks.
179
Troubleshooting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

→Move your mobile device closer to your wireless router.
R Your mobile device has too many wireless networks stored in its wireless network list.
→Use your mobile device’s “forget this wireless network” feature and delete any unnecessary/unused
wireless networks from the list. Refer to your mobile device’s operating instructions or support site
for details.
I cannot connect to the HD camera while at home ([Connection unsuccessful] is displayed)
R Your wireless router uses the 2.4 GHz band and the 5 GHz band (this is sometimes called a “dual
band” configuration), and your mobile device and HD camera cannot communicate.
→Dual band configurations are acceptable as long as devices that connect via the 2.4 GHz band are
able to communicate with devices that connect via the 5 GHz band. For example, if you have
configured your wireless router to use the 5 GHz band for normal use and the 2.4 GHz band for a
“guest network”, devices that connect using the 2.4 GHz band cannot connect to devices that
connect using the 5 GHz band. Refer to the operating instructions included with your wireless router
for details.
→Make sure your mobile device and HD camera are using the same band (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) to
connect to the wireless router. One way to do this is to make sure your wireless router uses different
SSIDs (i.e., wireless network names) for each band, and then make sure that your mobile device
and HD camera are connecting via the same SSID.
To change the SSID that your mobile device is using for wireless communication, change your
mobile device’s wireless network settings.
To change the SSID that the HD camera is using for wireless communication, reset the HD
camera’s wireless settings ( “Using the camera’s reset button”, Page 173) and then set up the
camera again.
I forgot the login password for the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera
→Connect to the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera while at home and change the
password. (The password is not required when your mobile device is connected to the same wireless
router as the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera.)
→If for some reason you cannot connect to the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera while at
home and change the password, force the shelf camera, floor camera, or window camera to reset its
settings ( “Resetting camera settings”, Page 114) and then configure the shelf camera, floor camera,
or window camera again.
I forgot the login password for the access point
→Connect to the access point while at home and change the password. (The password is not required
when your mobile device is connected to the same wireless router as the access point.)
→If for some reason you cannot connect to the access point while at home and change the password,
force the access point to reset its settings ( “Resetting camera settings”, Page 141) and then configure
the access point again.
I forgot the login password for the HD camera
→Set up the HD camera again by deregistering the camera from your mobile device ( “Deregistering
devices”, Page 41), and then registering it again ( “Registering devices”, Page 33).
→Set up the HD camera again by following the initial setup procedure (see  “Setting up the HD camera”,
Page 149).

Troubleshooting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No sound is heard in camera recordings
R If 
  is displayed next to the recording in the recording list, the system is configured to not record
audio when recording camera images.
→Change the [Recording with Sound] setting ( “Recording with sound”, Page 137).
R The volume is turned down on your mobile device.
→Adjust the volume of your mobile device.
Colors in camera images appear different from normal
R The camera is aimed at a dark location, or it is nighttime.
→If there is not adequate light to illuminate the subject, such as at night, the camera switches to night
vision mode depending on the settings ( “Using night vision”, Page 137). In this case, colors may
appear different from normal.
Colors in front door camera images appear washed out
R Lighting conditions are poor or inconsistent.
→Adjust the camera’s brightness ( “Changing the brightness”, Page 138).
→Place the camera in a different location or position.
Condensation forms on the camera
R Extreme temperature changes are causing condensation to form.
→Wipe the outer surface of the camera with a soft dry cloth.
→Use the camera in a location that does not have extreme temperature changes.
There is a long delay when talking to the camera while away from home
R Your mobile device’s network connection is slow or congested.
→Wait for network traffic to decrease.
→Lower the [Frame Rate] setting ( “Changing the frame rate”, Page 138).
Images are poor at night when the camera is installed in front of a window
R Night vision mode is causing images to have poor quality.
→Turn off night vision mode ( “Using night vision”, Page 137).
LEDs light at night
R Night vision mode is enabled and automatically turns on LEDs at night.
→Turn off night vision mode or set it to [Monochrome] ( “Using night vision”, Page 137).
Note:
R Turning off night vision mode will reduce the visibility of images at night.
Camera images are not displayed at first while away from home, and are displayed after some
time passes
R Your mobile device’s network connection is slow or congested.
→Wait for network traffic to decrease.
→Lower the [Frame Rate] setting ( “Changing the frame rate”, Page 138).
I have to wait a long time before camera images are displayed while away from home
R There is too much traffic on your home network or on the mobile device’s network.
→Wait for network traffic to decrease.
Camera images are not displayed, and [Loading...] is displayed for a long period when I try to
view camera images while away from home
R The protocol used for communication is not compatible with your network.
→Set the [Remote Access Mode] setting to [TCP] ( “Remote access mode settings”, Page 35).
The camera’s sensor is triggered too easily
R The camera’s motion detection features are too sensitive.
192
Troubleshooting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

→Reduce the sensitivity of the camera’s sensors, see  “Motion sensitivity”, Page 139.
R The camera’s detection area is too large.
→Limit the detection area so that the camera ignores motion in unneeded areas of the camera’s
image, i.e., reduce the camera’s detection area ( “Detection area”, Page 139).
R The camera’s settings are not suited to the environment.
→Review the information in the Installation Guide included with your camera about sensor features
and installation environment.
→Front door cameras and outdoor cameras can detect motion visually (i.e., when an area of the
camera’s image changes brightness). For this reason, false detections may occur in the following
locations.
False detections caused by predictable movement in a specific area of the camera image
– Areas where fixed objects move in the wind, such as tree branches or hanging laundry
– Areas where animals move in a limited area, such as birds in a nest or small animals close to the
ground
– Areas where brightness significantly, such as when shadows form in the afternoon, lights turn on
at night, or vehicles pass by at night with their headlights or brake lights on
You can prevent these false detections by adjusting the position of the camera, by limiting the
detection area so that the camera ignores motion in unneeded areas of the camera’s image
( “Detection area”, Page 139) or lowering the sensitivity of sensors ( “Motion sensitivity”, Page 139).
False detections caused by unpredictable movement in any area of the camera image
– Areas where birds or flying insects move in front of the camera
– Areas where rain, snow, hail, or tree leaves fall in front of the camera
You can prevent these false detections by adjusting the position of the camera or lowering the
sensitivity of sensors ( “Motion sensitivity”, Page 139).
[Ambient temperature is (too high) or (too low), camera operation will be interrupted.] is displayed
R The camera is used in an environment with a temperature that exceeds -20 °C or 50 °C (-4 °F to
122 °F).
→Use the camera in an environment with temperatures within -20 °C to 50 °C (-4 °F to 122 °F).
HD camera sensor features
Refer to the following after checking the general troubleshooting information described in  “General
information”, Page 176.
Notifications are not received
R The desired notification type is not enabled.
→Enable the desired notification type ( “[Notification Settings]”, Page 170).
R The camera’s date and time setting is incorrect.
→Adjust the date and time setting ( “HD camera device profiles”, Page 171).
Sensor detections are not displayed in the sensor history
R The desired feature is not enabled.
→Make sure the desired feature is enabled and configured as desired ( “Temperature sensor”,
Page 164,  “Sound sensor”, Page 164).
R The camera’s date and time setting is incorrect.
→Adjust the date and time setting ( “HD camera device profiles”, Page 171).
Colors in camera images appear different from normal
R The camera is aimed at a dark location, or it is nighttime.
→If there is not adequate light to illuminate the subject, such as at night, the camera switches to night
vision mode depending on the settings ( “Night vision mode”, Page 167). In this case, colors may
appear different from normal.
193
Troubleshooting

Usage precautions
 ●Do not freeze glass bottles,
that there is a risk of injury.
(If the liquid in a glass bottle is
frozen and broken, you may 
be injured.)
 ●Do not add a high impact on
glass trays. (Otherwise those
glass trays may break and you
may be injured.)
● Hold the refrigerator tightly 
when transporting.
● Apply protective covering,
etc. to ﬂoors with a fragile
surface.
● While opening the refrigerator, be careful
not to pinch other one’s hand holding the
door.
● Mind the gap between the doors. They may
nip your hand while closing the door.
 ●Do not refrigerate items which are bigger than 
tray or shelf, as the door will not close completely 
causing leakage of cool air.
 ●Do not open refrigerator frequently or leave it open 
for long time in order to prevent water dripping inside 
and waste energy. 
● Frequently check the door opening seal, it must be 
closed to the refrigerator’s body completely.
 ●Do not put anything on top of the 
frigerator. Otherwise, it may fall due 
to vibration. 
● When the plug is disconnected, leave 
it for 5 minutes before pluging again.  
If not, the compressor may not work. 
● Adjust the temperature according to 
the actual operating condition for energy  
saving. 
● If you will not be at home for several days and there 
are nothing refrigerated in the refrigerator, the plug 
should be disconnected for energy saving. 
● The outside wall of refrigerator cabinet may 
sometimes get warm, especially just after 
installation. This is quite normal, and is due to the 
built-in Mullion Dryer Pipe which prevents sweating 
and radiates heat. 
● When humidity is high, e.g. during rainy-season, 
condensation may appear on the surface of cabinet, 
especially around the door seal gasket. 
Wipe off the condensed water with a clean cloth. 
● The humidity inside the fresh case may condense so 
wipe it with a cloth periodically. Clean the fresh case 
once a month.
 ●Do not clean the refrigerator  with 
chemical substance or liquid. 
It will cause damage and have  
corrosion on the surface.
● Clean the evap pan located over the compressor at 
the back of the refrigerator every three months to 
prevent the odour generated from humidity.
 ●Do not place warm/hot foodstuff in the 
refrigerator.
 ●Do not overload the refrigerator. 
Gap must be provided between 
foodstuffs to maintain the cooling 
effect.
● Store fruits and vegetables in crisper,
where trapped moisture helps preserve
food quality for longer time periods.
● Drinking water, beverage bottles 
should be sealed to prevent the odour.
● Foodstuff such as vegetable, fruits 
and fresh food should be wrapped 
or pack in box before freezing and 
refrigerating.
● Put the food such as meat or .sh in the freezer if 
you want to store for an extended period.
● Cool hot dishes to room temperature before 
placing them in your refrigerator.
● Cover juicy foods with tight lids, plastic ﬁlm or foil.

Usage tips
I  Cool just before you eat!
It is not necessary to store uncut onions, 
potatoes, burdocks, etc. in the refrigerator 
(except during the summer).
If uncut tropical fruits are cooled down 
excessively, they may be discolored or 
their vitamin contents may decrease.
Do not put food in the refrigerator when it is not necessary.
Basics of energy saving
Save cool air!
Do not block the cold air outlet with food 
items!
If cool air does not spread into 
every corner of compartments, 
then the interior will not be 
electricity will be consumed.
Do not stuff food into the compartments.
If the cool air passage is blocked, then 
approx. 5 to 15% of electricity 
space between foods.
Store warm food and drinks after they 
have cooled.
Otherwise, they will not only raise 
the interior temperature, but also 
affect the freshness of other foods.

Speciﬁcations
Troubleshooting
● Are the temperature setting of refrigerator compartment set to 
something other than “Med” ?
● Did you open the doors frequently, or store very hot food?
● The learning function may automatically disable ECONAVI operation 
during times of frequent use.
ECONAVI does not 
operate.
 
● Is there a power failure? 
If a power failure occurs, the leaning function data collected up until 
that will be lost. ECONAVI operation will rarely be performed until the 
learning function has collected the data again.
ECONAVI operation is 
rarely performed.
ECONAVI operation 
is stopped part way 
though.
● If for example, defrosting (auto) is turned on during  
ECONAVI operation, the normal cooling operation will need to be 
performed afterwards so ECONAVI operation may be stopped.
● The learning function may be sometimes restart 
the normal cooling operation.
● Is the light intensity sensor hidden?
● Is there dirt scratches on the control panel  
(light intensity section)?
● ECONAVI operation may be performed while 
the refrigerator is being used depending on the 
conditions of use, but the cooling performance is 
maintained.
ECONAVI operation is 
performed too often 
(the ECONAVI lamp 
rarely turns off).
The ECONAVI lamp does not light properly.
